TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
quiz thing: the random word generator is annoying! coz I can't access it and test the code :(
got a cold this week and it turn to a fever 
    painful headache for two days :(  

Ok what I've leanrt this week.... recursion! It's not hard to understand and definately helpful in complicated codes!
Data project: kind of stucked, the Uber data are so complex and immense.... 
I think I would focus on a/some specfic area(s) and expand it to find something interesting?
