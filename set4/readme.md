TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Has consolidated basic functions in Python (eg:Range, while, if, for & in). 
Learnt json function to find information from a link, 
but still need to redo set4 exercises to reinforce the logic behind. 
For the data project, was struggled to find an interesting topic with enormous databases, 
but seems it has been solved now. Ready to set the Panda things.
